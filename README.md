# About me
 I am a graduate student at NHR graduate school. Simultaneously hosted by Prof Andreas Görling, Lehrstuhl für Theoretische Chemie, FAU Erlangen. My hometown is Rajkot, in Gujarat, India.

# Research Interest
- **Fields of Interest** - Random Phase Approxiation based methods,  σ-Functionals, Kohn-Sham Formalism, Kohn-Sham Inversion, Electronic structure theory, and Computational Material Science.
- I am passionate about advancing methods to simulate electron correlation by leveraging to insightful Quantum chemistry formalism and High performace computing.
